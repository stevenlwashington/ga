    <article id="aboutme">
      <p id="heading">About Me</p><p>I'm a geek, sports analysis enthusiast, and caffeine addict. Originally from the Bay Area in California, was raised in South King County, and grew up in Southern California. I now reside in the Interbay Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle.</p><p>Monday through Friday, I invest my time learning computer science and building productive musical playlists. Web development is a new field for me, so I take this seriously and have just a little tiny bit of fun doing it. My 4.5 year old Goldendoodle, Leia, is my number one fan, and also keeps me on my toes. On the weekend i'm usually out of town with friends, hosting visitors, watching sports (go Hawks!), hiking, and exploring unknown pockets of Seattle.</p><p>I discovered coding in high school, but did not continue my education in this field. I was drawn to business management, entrepreneurship, and marketing. After a short stint at the Art Institute of California-San Diego, I transitioned to a marketing education at San Diego State University. Since then, I have been an analyst in the e-commerce space working primarily for startups and mid-size companies. I have focused on market yield management, sales operations and strategy, product life cycles, digital ad operations, media planning, and data analysis.</p><p></p><p>Outside of developing, I enjoy working with web performance data, psychographic consumer profiling, geospatial analysis, visualizing data, site mapping, behavioral-based and dynamic content marketing, and product life cycles.

      <p id="heading">Why General Assembly?</p><p>I am applying to General Assembly WDI program because I want to become more proficient as a developer in a different environment than what Code Fellows had to offer me. I took their Computer Science bootcamp in July/August and also their intermediate JavaScript night course. My goal is to leverage my new superpowers and depend on my 6+ years professional experience in increasing revenue through operational efficiency and business process improvement to become a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer and eventually a Product Manager.</p>

      <p id="heading">What have I learned so far?</p><p>Recently, I was part of a team that learned to leverage Node.js to build a simple server that eventually led us to deploying numerous applications using Heroku.</p><p>I am also studying computer science concepts such as organizing complex data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, as well as industry standard development and version control tools. Looking forward to diving more into the MEAN stack and further my JavaScript skills. I would also like to explore Python down the road.</p>
