    <article id="aboutme">
      <p id="heading">About Me</p><p>I'm a sports analysis enthusiast and caffeine addict. Originally from the Bay Area in California, was raised in South King County, and grew up in Southern California. I now reside in the Interbay Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle.</p><p>My background is in analytics (sales operations, web, social), and have recently picked up web development. My 4.5 year old Goldendoodle, Leia, is my number one fan, and also keeps me on my toes. On the weekend i'm usually out of town with friends, hosting visitors, watching sports (<a href="https://vimeo.com/119362723" target="_newtab" id="hawks">Go Hawks!</a>), hiking, or exploring unknown pockets of Seattle.</p><p>As a child I was drawn to customizing video game options, analyzing the interwebs, and questioning user experiences. In high school, I was attracted to participating in DECA which exposed me to business management, entrepreneurship, and marketing. After a short stint at the Art Institute of California-San Diego, I transitioned to a marketing education at San Diego State University. Since then, I have been an analyst in the e-commerce space working primarily for startups and mid-size companies. I have focused on market yield management, sales operations and strategy, product life cycles, ad operations, media planning, and data analysis.</p><p>In addition to studying web development, I enjoy working with web performance data, psychographic consumer profiling, geospatial data, visualizing data, site mapping, behavioral-based and dynamic content marketing, and product life cycles.</p>

    <article id="webdev">
      <p id="heading">Web Development</p><p>Currently studying Computer Science and JavaScript so that I may evolve into a highly analytical and programmatic product manager. Recently, I was part of a team that learned to leverage Node.js to build a simple server that eventually led us to deploying applications using Heroku.</p><p>I have also learned computer science concepts such as organizing complex data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, as well as industry standard development and version control tools. Looking forward to diving deeper into the MEAN stack and further my JavaScript skills. My goal is to become proficient with technical teams, development and analytics so that I can transition into a decisive product manager.</p>
