Steven Washington About Me Single Page App

1. Some things I wanted to do, but did not get to as I understand there is a timeline on admissions.
1a. Include clickable social media logos in the footer. Add minor animation to them. ie) FB, TW, LINK, GOOG, GITHUB, IG, ETC.
1b. Stylize and animate the "back to top" buttons
1c. Design a logo to be place in top left corner of fixed toolbar
1d. Create JS if statement for the copywrite year in footer. Want it to automatically update per current year.
1e. Create better navigational flow when clicking buttons. I want it to flow slowly rather than a quick jump to the referenced element.
1f. Better 'easter egg' when hovering over my image :)

2. Resources
2a. Stack Overflow
2b. MDN
2c. Codepen
2d. Adobe Color CC
2e. Google Fonts
